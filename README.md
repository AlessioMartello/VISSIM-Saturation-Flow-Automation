# VISSIM-Saturation-Flow-Automation
Calculates the Saturation flow from VISSIM special evaluation files.

Using Special Evaluation files output from VISSIM (see pg 558 of https://www.et.byu.edu/~msaito/CE662MS/Labs/VISSIM_530_e.pdf)
The saturation flow per stopline in the VISSIM model will be evaluated.

Ensure that all the Special evaluation files are in a folder on the same level, relative to the .py file. Name this folder "Special_eval_files".

The only input is the maximum headway accepted.
